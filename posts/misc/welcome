Welcome to my blog! My name is Kody Kantor. I'm a software engineer in
Minnesota.

I vividly remember some parts of my first computer science class at the
University of St Thomas in September 2012. I got to the class well ahead of
time and sat in the front row. To my left was Maddi, to my right was Derek.

The professor walked into the classroom wearing a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.
He had a white beard, a little hair, and circular glasses. At some point
while we were going through the syllabus he said to the class,

"Not all of you will make it through this class. None of you know how to solve
problems. Some of you think that you do, but you don't. I'm going to teach you
how to solve problems the right way. But you should all have a backup plan in
the case that you don't pass."

Then he looked at me and said, "Like you! Do you have a backup plan?" To which
I replied, "Nope!"

So here we are. Although I did pass the class, maybe I didn't learn how to solve
problems the right way... There are many 'better' ways to host a blog nowadays.
But for me, this is fine. It's probably better that nobody sees my ramblings
anyways :-).

none) and HTML. It's just not necessary to be showy when serving static files.
