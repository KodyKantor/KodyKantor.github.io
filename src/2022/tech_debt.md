# Enjoying technical debt
#### 2022-05-08

## Introduction

I've found a method to help me enjoy working on technical debt. This method
helps me to be more productive and motivates me to do my other work. I'll share
it with you here. 

## Where does technical debt come from?

Technical debt can come in many forms. You will commonly hear that technical
debt comes as a result of taking shortcuts when building software. This is
certainly one place where technical debt comes from.

### Shortcuts

In a perfect world we will never take shortcuts when designing software.
Unfortunately time is a valuable resource! Sometimes shortcuts when building
software can be necessary to quickly demonstrate concepts. After the concept is
demonstrated to stakeholders we need to make a decision: continue using the
concept code (ignore the tech debt), or replace the concept code with a long-term
solution (pay down the debt).

The software industry has no shortage of euphemisms for shortcuts: proof of
concept and 'demo code' are common. We even have a name for engineers who do
this type of work often: rockstars!

Sometimes shortcuts are necessary. The organization you find yourself in may
dictate how often you take shortcuts. For example, an organization where there
is a strong vision and agreement between parties may not require many shortcuts -
the emphasis is on delivering a good solution to customers. In an organization
that doesn't value being thorough or one that isn't as focused on a shared
vision you may find yourself taking more shortcuts to convince others of your
idea.

Technical debt can be used as leverage. We only have a finite amount of time to
build software. Choosing to take on technical debt by taking a shortcut means we 
are essentially borrowing time from the future to achieve our goals sooner. This
can be incredibly valuable! After all, there is an infinite amount of time in
the future that we can use as leverage, and the time before the next demo is
certainly finite!

### Low priority tasks

Some work just isn't a priority, so it ends up languishing in the backlog.
Every software project I have seen has an infinitely growing backlog. Software
can always be improved! This is another popular place for tech debt to grow.

This form of tech debt is what we will discuss in this blog post. I see the
growing backlog as a pile of pleasure, not a mountain of pain!

## Addressing technical debt

Participants in a software project tend to see technical debt as a weeping sore.
It's something that bothers us and makes it harder to make progress. Many of us
have participated in discussions with product owner explaining that progress is
slowing down because of tech debt.

### Common methods

I've experience a number of ways that organizations attempt to pay down tech
debt:

- Tech debt sprints. All feature work is paused for two weeks while tech debt is
  addressed.
- Tech debt hackathons. Feature work is paused for a day while tech debt is
  addressed. This might happen between sprints, on a quarterly basis, or on some
  other interval.
- Allocating time to address high priority tech debt. During sprint planning
  some tasks are taken by the team to pay down tech debt.
- Rewriting the software. In one organization all of the software was rewritten
  every few years. Can't have tech debt if the software ceases to exist!

### My recent attempts

Recently I have been trying something else: dedicating up to an hour per day to
unprioritized work of my choosing. This provides many benefits to me and the
team.

### Autonomy

I choose which tasks I take on. Nobody asked me to do this work, so
I feel that it is a great opportunity to choose how and when I perform these
tasks.

### Mastery

I use this time to learn new things. Rather than taking on work
that is familiar to me I will take on a task that will allow me to learn a new
tool or learn a new area of the system.

### Purpose

Taking on this work not only makes me feel good due to the previous
two points, but it helps me to make others on my team more productive. This
pays dividends! The best way to succeed is to make sure your project succeeds,
and one way to do this is to enable your coworkers to do good work.

### Increased productivity

When I am working on a difficult problem I often find
it benefitial to stop and focus on something else for a short time. This
allows my subconcious to continue chewing on the problem while I do something
else. Paying tech debt is a productive break from critical work.

## The playbook

### Choose the work

I prefer to choose small tasks. Preferably the task can be completed in a few
hours of work. Taking an hour per day to work on this means that I
have submitted one 'bonus' change each week. This is a great motivator that
makes me feel even more productive.

If the work you want to take is large, see if you can break it up into small
pieces that each deliver value. For example, if you've always wanted to make a
version of your service that relies on no external dependencies (maybe useful
to make testing easeir), see if you can start by adding a trait/interface for
interacting with one external dependency. If you lose motivation for your long
term goal at least you have made testing one module easier.

### Make the time

I start some mornings by dedicating an hour to this type of work. Starting my
morning with learning something new of my choosing helps me to look forward to
work each day. Dedicating mornings to this work makes it easier to allocate
the time. Let's think about the opposite case: you crunch through critical work
for most of the day and then try to jump to non-critical work. This is not a
good model for me. I find that my brain is still intensely focused on the high
priority work and I cannot concentrate on learning the necessary concepts to
accomplish the low priority task.

### Strictly time box

It is important to strictly time box this work, both in the micro (up to one
hour each day) and in the macro (if your one-hour increments add up to 40 hours
you should consider if the task can be made smaller). This is unprioritized
work, after all. We should always be focused on helping our team succeed. Often
this means spending your time working on high priority tasks.

## Conclusion

I've had great success following this model recently. I may go a month without
doing this work, or I may dedicate an hour each day for a month to unprioritized
work! I am happiest when I make the time to do what I outlined here.
