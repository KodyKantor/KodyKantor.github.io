<h3>A tree in the forest</h3>

<p>
I've always enjoyed writing simulators to describe our production
environment. In late 2020 we had a question that merited a simulator: how much
network and disk IO do we need to buy for our storage system?
</p>

<p>
When we first asked this question we were armed with a manual calculation that
someone from Samsung had put together. It was a tree diagram that described a
typical network and rack architecture with nodes indicating some type of
hardware, and edges indicating network connections between nodes. At the top of
the diagram is a description of the workload and environment.
</p>

<p>
For example, one environment might consist of a single 12 node storage cluster
with four parity blocks and eight data blocks per erasure coding stripe and be
deployed across three datacenters without 'bin packing' racks. The description
would also note how much throughput would be happening in the cluster at any
given time, expressed in gigabits per second.
</p>

<p>
The diagram itself noted how much data would happen on each node in the
cluster with the given workload and configuration. For example, maybe the
workload was 100gbps of write-only traffic. In this case, the Internet-facing
switch would serve 100gbps of network traffic, and split that 100gbps evenly
between three more switches, each in a different datacenter. With simple math we
can determine that each of those three second-level switches served (at least)
~33gbps of throughput. Then we can further divide the throughput to the ToRs and
machines in each region. A simplified example is shown below.
</p>

<p>
After this point the calculations get much more complicated. Due to EC write
inflation across three datacenters the 33gbps number isn't accurate. It ended
up being that each switch would see ~125gbps of combined rx/tx throughput.
</p>

<p>
Although the calculations are relatively simple for a single cluster and a
handful of racks, the problem of estimating network and disk IO requirements
quickly becomes unwieldy for a single mind to compute or for a tree diagram to
display. Good thing we have computers!
</p>

<h3>Admitted Google Drive lover</h3>

<p>
I have what could probably be described as an irational love of creating
diagrams and calculators in Google Drive. I started the ZFS capacity usage
simulator in a Google Sheet, and the cluster throughput simulator also started
as a Google Sheet. All of the architecture diagrams I draw are done in Google
Slides... It's just so easy to get started things in Google Drive and is easy to
share with technical and non-technical folks alike.
</p>

<p>
After a day of fighting with Google Sheets calculations and the inability
to easily write comments for myself I decided to migrate the cluster throughput
simulator to Python. Making the jump from trying to beat Google Sheets into
submission to Python was amazing. Being able to represent racks, switches,
machines, datacenters, and regions as Python objects was incredibly powerful,
and we were able to quickly put together a program that reproduced the trivial
throughput diagrams that were provided to us.

<p>
Now that we had the primitives in place to simulate arbitrary topologies, only
a bit more tweaking allows us to churn out network simulations for an
arbitrary number of clusters, racks, datacenters, machines, erasure coding
parameters, and even whether or not our simulated deployment system used a
bin-pack or spread algorithm. Once we had the primitives in place I was curious
what disk IO looked like, so by adding just a few lines of code we knew how much
disk throughput would be required for a given user workload.
</p>

<p>
This tool continues to help us to understand and explain how data moves in our
datacenters. It was great fun writing this tool (even when I was writing it in
Google Sheets!). I had forgotten about the story of this tool until a colleague
and I were discussing the relative ease of debugging some languages over
others. This was the first project where I found myself using the Python
debugger.
</p>

<p>
I hope that you enjoyed this brief look at a simple solution to a complicated
problem. If you're curious to see the simulator (and maybe step through it in
the Python debugger :) ) you can the code
