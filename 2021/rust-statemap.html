<h3></h3>

<p>
I suppose this blog is turning into a place where I can talk about my obsession
with writing simulators. My hope is that if I dump my thoughts here where
nobody will read them then I will save my coworkers from having to listen to
boring stories about the origins of various bugs.
</p>

<p>
Bryan Cantrill wrote a tool in the latter part of his career at Joyent called
Statemap. I've written about statemaps in the past, specifically in 2019 when
we were looking at <a href=../2019/pg_temp_files.html>PostgreSQL temp file IO</a>,
and in 2020 when we used Statemaps to <a href=../2020/minio_tracing.html>debug pathological performance in MinIO</a>.
In fact, in the 2020 post about MinIO I alluded to writing about rust-statemap
and the manta-chum integration in the future.
</p>

<p>
To level-set again, we need to talk about how confusing the term 'statemap' is.
'Statemap' can refer to any of these three things:
<ol>
	<li>An SVG file (a statemap rendering)</li>
	<li>Lines of JSON data in specific formats (sometimes referred to as 'instrumentation output')</li>
	<li>A program that turns JSON into an SVG (the statemap tool)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
When we set out to build rust-statemap we wanted to do two things:
<ol>
	<li>Define the statemap line protocol</li>
	<li>Provide a library for Rust programs to use the statemap line protocol</li>
</ol>

The Joyent <a href=https://github.com/joyent/statemap>statemap tool</a> includes
a private API and definitions of the statemap line protocol. When the statemap
tool was written I believe it was mostly intended for use with DTrace, though
the door was open for other forms of instrumentation. Since we were writing a
lot of Rust code (which is hard to instrument with DTrace, though I did create
<a href=https://github.com/KodyKantor/rdt>a PoC tool</a> to add DTrace probes to
Rust programs), we needed a way to generate statemap instrumentation output
in a relatively idiomatic way.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, long story short I did a bunch of work to define a public statemap API
with Rust bindings to make it easy for Rust programmers to generate statemap
instrumentation output and called it <a href=https://github.com/KodyKantor/rust-statemap>rust-statemap</a>.
</p>

<h3>manta-chum statemaps</h3>

<p>
The first time we used rust-statemap was for our 'minio statemap' tool, which I
already described in 2020. The second use was in
<a href=https://github.com/joyent/manta-chum>manta-chum</a>. manta-chum is a
load-generating tool the supports a bunch of common file protocols: s3, webdav,
and posix. It seeks to bridge the gap between micro-benchmarks like fio and
mega-benchmarks like COSbench.
</p>

<p>
manta-chum runs with a bunch of 'normal' synchronous threads (no green-threading
stuff, except where it couldn't be avoided), and we wanted to see what each
thread was doing during a benchmark. We wired up rust-statemap and gained a few
cool things:
<ul>
	<li>We knew the operations performed by each thread</li>
	<li>The duration of each operation is recorded</li>
	<li>We can consul, and slice/dice the above two data points at any time
		and in any way</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Take this example run of manta-chum on my laptop, below. In this test we ran
manta-chum with its default settings: 1 thread, mix of read/write operations,
writing to the local filesystem with fsync enabled after each write. Feel free
to use the + and - magnifiers and click on the graph to interact with the
statemap. I suggest zooming in to discover what happens between the blue 'fsync'
operations. Each line on the y axis (there is only one) represents a thread,
and the x axis represents time beginning when the manta-chum process spawns and
ending when the manta-chum process finished writing the statemap data file.
</p>

<p>
If you zoom in and pan around you can see that this single thread is spending
all of its time issuing fsync syscalls, 24ms at a time. Then between fsync
operations the thread is issuing read, write, open, and mkdir calls, all of
which finish quickly.
</p>

<p>
This is interesting, but what happens if we have a bunch
of threads doing IO at the same time? Here's another statemap rendering from
manta-chum, this time with 10 threads running at the same time:
</p>

<iframe src="assets/ten-chum-threads.svg" title="ten threads" style="border:none;" scrolling=no width=1024 height=400></iframe>

<p>
There is a lot more happening in that statemap. Notably, everything is much
slower. open, fsync, and mkdir calls can all take over 100ms each. The read
syscalls are still nearly instant.
</p>

<p>
Now, what happens if we remove that pesky fsync call? Let's run the same test,
but with fsync disabled.
</p>

<iframe src="assets/ten-chum-threads-no-fsync.svg" title="ten threads no fsync" style="border:none;" scrolling=no width=1024 height=400></iframe>

<p>
Bonkers! This time the ten threads wrote 5GB in 2 seconds, but the previous two
runs wrote ~200MB in 16 seconds. Of course the 5GB written during this test is
just buffered in memory. This statemap rendering shows a lot of interesting
things that raise a lot of questions:
<ul>
	<li>Why is there an occasional ~6ms pause across all chum threads?</li>
	<li>Why do read operations suddenly take much longer after 1.2 seconds of benchmark runtime?</li>
	<li>Approximately every second all of the mkdir and open calls take a long time across all threads. What gives?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>A new hope (for the future)</h3>

<p>
In the end we have been happy to have the rust-statemap library for learning
more about how our rust applications work. Along the way we found a bunch of
rough edges with the statemap protocol. Rather than repeating them all here,
check out the list of 'Statemap protocol moans and niggles' in the rust-statemap
repository's <a href=https://github.com/KodyKantor/rust-statemap/blob/master/README.md#statemap-protocol-moans-and-niggles>README</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately manta-chum helped us to realize that we couldn't bring our storage
product up to a level of performance that would compete with newer storage
systems. manta-chum was the last piece of Rust code I anticipate working on for
quite a while. If I end up writing more rust in the future I would love to
address these statemap protocol issues so it's even easier to create statemaps.
